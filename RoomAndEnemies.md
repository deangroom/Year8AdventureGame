# What is this file about

In this code, a dictionary named enemies is defined. It contains information about different types of enemies that can be encountered in a game.

The keys in the enemies dictionary are the names of the enemies, such as "Goblin", "Orc", and "Troll".
The values associated with each enemy name are sub-dictionaries that contain information about the enemy's attributes, including health, attack, and defense.

For example, the "Goblin" enemy has a health of 10, an attack of 2, and a defense of 1.

The code is useful for storing and accessing information about different types of enemies in a game. It allows easy retrieval of enemy attributes based on their names.
