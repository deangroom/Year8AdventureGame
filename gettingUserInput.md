The first block of code contains a dictionary named enemies, which stores information about different types of enemies in the game.
Each enemy is a key-value pair in the dictionary, where the key represents the enemy's name (e.g., "Goblin", "Orc", "Troll"), and the value is another dictionary containing attributes of the enemy, such as their health, attack, and defense.

The next block of code declares a dictionary named game_map that represents the game map.
The game_map dictionary contains a key called "rooms", and its corresponding value is a list containing information about different rooms in the game.
Each room is represented by a dictionary with keys such as "name", "description", "exits", and "enemies".
The "name" key stores the room's name (e.g., "1", "2").
The "description" key holds the description of the room.
The "exits" key contains a list of other rooms that can be accessed from the current room.
The "enemies" key specifies the enemy present in that room.
